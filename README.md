# EasyDefine


Easydefine is a simple way to get all the definitions/etymology/data about a word in one page. We check multiple sources to get as much data about a word as possible. Additionally, we aim to be perfect for school assignments as in the future you will have the option to paste in a vocab list, (or import it through google drive or by taking a photo), and quickly generate flashcards and more with the deinitions, translations, and any other information included!

Easydefine is still a work in progress and you can make pull requests to this repository if you would like to help out.
